A [cctbx](https://cctbx.github.io/)-style toolbox to describe single-crystal diffraction experiments. This fork extends the toolbox to account for neutron diffraction experiments, as part of [extending DIALS for neutron diffraction](https://github.com/toastisme/dials).

Initially implemented to support [xia2](https://github.com/xia2/xia2) development, dxtbx is designed to be extensible, to support other applications and to make it easy to work with other detectors, with a generic approach to reading the data files.

A paper describing how to use dxtbx, as well as documenting its development and some of its applications, was published as [J. Appl. Cryst. (2014) **47**, 1459-1465](https://doi.org/10.1107/S1600576714011996).
